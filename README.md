# Lyrebird

Lyrebird helps you tweet faster and eaier from events by automatically appending the hashtags for you.

## Installation

Because I have lazily not created a requirements file yet you will need to install some things. It's recommended you do this in a virtual environment.

```
pip install colorama tweepy
```

## Use

Launch the script for each new talk so you can change the hashtags. There isn't a way to do this without existing at the moment.

```
python lyrebird-cli.py
```
